Terence Lines joined the Indicative Data Science lab in 2018.

Terry's research interests are the use of low quality spatial data for inference about urban environments. Many new forms of data are crowdsourced or automatically collected without controls on quality. Both theoretical and applied methods are required in order to measure uncertainty and make inferences. In particular, Terry is interested in techniques to combine overlapping poor quality but independent data sources to investigate the environmental processes leading to data creation through the use of statistical models and weakly-supervised machine learning techniques.
