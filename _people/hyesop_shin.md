Hyesop Shin joined the Indicative Data Science lab in 2020.

Hyesop is a quantitative geographer interested in themes including environmental hazards, urban air quality, individual mobility patterns, which are likely to be real-world problems. To tackle these issues, Hyesop applies methods including GIScience and agent-based modelling (ABM). Prior to joining Glasgow, Hyesop completed his PhD at the University of Cambridge where he looked at how individuals exposure to air pollution can differ by commuting routes and socioeconomic backgrounds using an agent-based simulation. At Glasgow, Hyesop's current project unravels the benefits of using crowdsourcing to help improve our understanding of locational services for the under-represented groups. One example is to highlight toilets, childcare service, domestic violence shelters for women, and provide wheelchair service points and pathfinding routes for the physically disabled.
